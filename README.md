# Florida Travel Guide

In this project, I developed a web application for personalized travel recommendations in the state of Florida using  kernel density maps of geo-referenced points of attraction across the state. The application contanins a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline based on named-entity recognition and sentiment analysis to process users' textual description of their ideal trip.
